## Usage
The program uses a `<name>.l2c` file to configure the way the log parser should work. <br />
At each execution the `.l2c` file and the `<name>.log` file are provided and the resulting `output.csv` will be generated.

This is being done to enable as much configuration possibilities with this small log parser.
